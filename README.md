# Install & Uninstall

For manual installs, extract the archive into "Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord." Then activate the "DiplomacyFixes" module in your game's launcher.
If you installed manually, then delete the "DiplomacyFixes" folder from "Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules."

Mod manager users (i.e. Vortex) should grab a Nexus Mods release instead.

Theoretically it's safe to install for existing saves, as after a brief test I could open the kingdom menu and use features without crashes. Uninstalling on existing saves isn't recommended though, as I hadn't tested nor heard anything about if it'll break factions' AI. Be careful with saves you want to keep either way.
